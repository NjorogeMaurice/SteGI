        <p class="mt-4 text-center text-gray-500 ">Since Covid-19 pandemic was pronounced in march 2020, Kenya is experiencing very disturbing impacts of COVID- 19 in the rising numbers of teenage pregnancies among the school girls of ages 12-18 years occasioned by the covid-19 lockdown. Though comprehensive national data on the impact of COVID-19 on teen pregnancy rates are not yet available, it is estimated that close to 4,000 school girls are impregnated in central parts of Kenya during COVID-19 lockdown”, followed by another estimated number of 3,964 teenage pregnancies of girls aged between 12-16 years in Machakos county among others as reported by Kenya media houses.  The School closures occasioned by the SARS-COV-19 pandemic did cut off the school girls from their teachers whom in most cases raises the alarm in suspected cases of abuse at home, and at the moment the students have been left idle and often unchaperoned by busy parents. Restrictions on movement during the COVID 19 pandemics also made it harder for girls to access contraceptives and family planning services, and mandatory curfews have trapped girls in homes with predatory family members and neighbors.</p>

        <p class="mt-4 text-center text-gray-500 ">Underpinning the COVID-19- rise in teen pregnancies the other significant challenges aggravating the rise in cases of teenage pregnancies includes, loss of jobs by parents and guardians exposing girls to very vulnerable situation of predators who are taking advance of their inability to get sanitary facilities,  lack of a well-organized teenage sexual education program at community levels,  insufficient funding for reproductive health services and a lack of comprehensive sex education in schools – which have contributed to Kenya’s alarming numbers of teenage pregnancies. Though comprehensive national government tally on the impact of COVID-19 on teen pregnancy are not yet available many articles published within this period of SARS_COV 19 have also failed to put the numbers of teen pregnancies into context. Kenya as a country is also classified as high-risk early teenage pregnancy and for long time it has as well been a societal challenge. The government demographic data of 2014, the latest available, shown that 15 percent of girls aged 15-19 had already given birth, and another three percent were pregnant with their first child – the heist in eastern Africa region. </p>

        <p class="mt-4 text-center text-gray-500 ">This situation has been aggraviated by the fact that COVID-19 pandemic has made it worse coupled with disappearing funding by the US government that has historically been a major contributor   to Kenya’s healthcare budget. But since president Donald Trump reinstated and expanded the policy that prohibits funding to NGOs that supported teenage girls sanitary needs from poor families and offered counseling, referrals, or services related to abortion that was often referred to as the Mexico City policy or the global gag rule,  Kenyan reproductive health and family planning organizations have struggled with reducing financing and majority have had to close their doors, according to the NGO Family Health Options Kenya. The institutions that used to provide those services have had to shut down and therefore the opportunities of access to knowledge and reproductive health services have virtually diminished in most of the Kenyan rural villages and particularly in the populated slum areas and in rural areas of central Kenya Machakos and other counties as well.  </p>

        <p class="mt-4 text-center text-gray-500 ">It is this disturbing background that clinical medicine female students’ advocacy and peer education organization dabbed “Safe the teenage girl initiative” from impacts of Covid-19 program, an initiative under the broad umbrella of “Women Access to Rural Health Foundation (WARHF)” was founded. Its main aim is to bring together stakeholder to mitigate the impacts of covid-19 on the teenage girls, referred to as (STAGI-COV-19-initiative).</p>

                <p class="text-gray-600">In 2013, the Kenyan government committed scaling up sex education, beginning courses in primary schools. But efforts to make good on this promise have been met with fierce opposition from conservative and religious groups. Currently, when sex education is taught at all, courses focus largely on HIV prevention and abstinence — which means students’ knowledge of reproductive and sexual health is often limited and will remain so for a long time.
The ideology of “Parents or teacher told us, ‘Those things are taught in school. We do not talk to our children about sex. That is a taboo. Majority of Kenyan parents expect that the teachers should tell their children about sex and about how to protect themselves. 
Kenya’s parliament is currently debating legislation mandating age-appropriate sex education in schools but religious leaders and cultural conservatives have launched an aggressive campaign against the bill, arguing that such a curriculum runs counter to Kenyan cultural values. They’ve taken to the airwaves and social media platforms to encourage a public backlash against the bill.

                <p class="text-gray-600">Today the pregnancy and childbirth complications are the leading cause of death among girls aged 15–19 years globally and particularly to developing countries like Kenya, as per the WHO 2017 reports. Another study done in Kenya on to the causes of maternal deaths revealed that nine percent of women who died in the hospital during child birth were teenagers. 
Of pregnant teenagers who survive childbirth, nearly 98 percent drop out of school, a survey conducted in Kenya last year by Plan International shown that of pregnant teenagers who survive childbirth, nearly 98 percent drop out of school.
