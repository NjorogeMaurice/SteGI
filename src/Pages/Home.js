               <p>Teenage pregnancy is of global concern, but most is of key issue in poorer and marginalized communities in Kenya. This is much contributed by the fact that girls in rural underserved communities face considerable challenges that includes less education resulting from low economic status, girls with pressure of being married off during early stages following cultural practices, hence being denied the right to make decisions about their sexual and reproductive health, girls at risk sexual abuse among others. Teenage girls have freedom to make their own decisions about their bodies in matters of reproductive live and more about their futures. They should also be able to understand the effects of teenage pregnancy, and have access to appropriate healthcare services and comprehensive sexuality education.
Save the teenage girl initiative (STeGI) is one of the initiatives under the big umbrella of ‘Women Access to Rural Health Foundation’ (WARHF).
